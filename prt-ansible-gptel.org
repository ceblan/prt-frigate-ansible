*** write an ansible playbook that:
		1. copy the local file
           "/home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar" into
           the directory "/home/sice/instalacion"
		2. Untar FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar in
           "//home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/"
		3. Execute "dpkg -i *" in directory
           "//home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/PODMAN-PKGS/"

Here's an Ansible playbook that accomplishes the tasks you specified:

#+begin_src yaml 
---
- name: Install Frigate
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Copy FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar to destination
      copy:
        src: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar
        dest: /home/sice/instalacion/

    - name: Untar FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar
      unarchive:
        src: /home/sice/instalacion/FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar
        dest: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/
        remote_src: yes

    - name: Execute dpkg -i in PODMAN-PKGS directory
      command: dpkg -i *
      args:
        chdir: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/PODMAN-PKGS/
#+end_src

*** Explanation:
1. The =copy= module copies the specified tar file to the destination directory.
2. The =unarchive= module extracts the tar file at the designated location.
3. The =command= module runs =dpkg -i *= in the specified directory to install the packages. 

*** Usage:
Save this playbook in a file named =install_frigate.yml=, and execute it using:
#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook install_frigate.yml
#+end_src

*** Oops, "dpkg -i *" has to be executed as sudo. Can you fix it?

Certainly! Here's the updated Ansible playbook with the =dpkg -i *= command executed with =sudo=:

#+begin_src yaml :tangle ansible/tasks/podman-install.yml
---
- name: Install Frigate
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Copy FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar to destination
      copy:
        src: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar
        dest: /home/sice/instalacion/

    - name: Untar FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar
      unarchive:
        src: /home/sice/instalacion/FRIGATE-INSTALL.tar
        dest: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/
        remote_src: yes

    - name: Execute dpkg -i in PODMAN-PKGS directory
      command: sudo dpkg -i *
      args:
        chdir: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/PODMAN-PKGS/
#+end_src

*** Note:
Make sure that the user running the Ansible playbook has permission to run =sudo=
without a password prompt, or that you set up the necessary =become= directives
for privilege escalation:

#+begin_src yaml
    - name: Execute dpkg -i in PODMAN-PKGS directory
      command: dpkg -i *
      args:
        chdir: /home/concesion/instalacion/DVAS/FRIGATE/PODMAN-PKGS/
      become: yes
#+end_src

*** Usage:
Save the changes to your playbook and run it as before:

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook install_frigate.yml
#+end_src

*** Can you make a playbook that modifies /etc/sudoers to make the user "sice" run sudo without password?

Certainly! Below is an Ansible playbook that modifies the =/etc/sudoers= file to
allow the user "sice" to run =sudo= without a password.

#+begin_src yaml
---
- name: Configure sudoers for user 'sice'
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure 'sice' can run sudo without a password
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/sudoers
        line: 'sice ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
        validate: 'visudo -cf %s'
#+end_src

*** Explanation:
1. *lineinfile Module*: This module is used to ensure that the specified line is
   present in the =/etc/sudoers= file.
2. *validate*: This option checks the syntax of the =/etc/sudoers= file after the
   modification. It uses =visudo -cf= to validate the changes before applying them
   to avoid syntax errors that could lock out sudo access.
3. *line*: The line being added allows the user "sice" to execute any command with
   =sudo= without being prompted for a password.

*** Usage:
Save this playbook in a file named =configure_sudoers.yml=, and run it using:

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook configure_sudoers.yml
#+end_src

*** Important Notice:
- Modify the sudoers file with caution as incorrect entries can lead to serious
  issues. Always validate syntax when making changes.
- If you're running this playbook on a system where sudoers changes might impact
  other users, consider adding comments or using sudoers.d directory for easier
  management.

*** Do I need become to run the previous playbook?

Yes, you will need to use =become= to run the previous playbook because modifying
the =/etc/sudoers= file requires root (superuser) privileges. Hereâ€™s the updated
playbook with the necessary =become= directive:

#+begin_src yaml
---
- name: Configure sudoers for user 'sice'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure 'sice' can run sudo without a password
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/sudoers
        line: 'sice ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
        validate: 'visudo -cf %s'
#+end_src

*** Usage
Save this playbook and run it as follows:

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook configure_sudoers.yml
#+end_src

*** Important Note
Make sure that the user you are running the playbook as has permission to use
=sudo= or has =sudo= privileges, otherwise, you will encounter permission errors.

*** let's do it differently. Make a playbook that adds sice to the sudo group and then include NOPASSWD for group sudo in /etc/sudoers

Sure! Below is an Ansible playbook that adds the user "sice" to the "sudo" group
and modifies the =/etc/sudoers= file to allow all members of the "sudo" group to
run sudo commands without a password.

#+begin_src yaml
---
- name: Configure sudo access for user 'sice'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Add user 'sice' to the 'sudo' group
      user:
        name: sice
        groups: sudo
        append: yes

    - name: Allow members of the sudo group to run sudo without password
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/sudoers
        line: '%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
        validate: 'visudo -cf %s'
#+end_src

*** Explanation:
1. *Add user to the sudo group*:
   - The =user= module adds the user "sice" to the "sudo" group, ensuring that the
     group membership is retained by setting =append: yes=.

2. *Modify sudoers file*:
   - The =lineinfile= module adds the line allowing all users in the "sudo" group
     to execute commands without a password prompt.
   - The =validate= option ensures that the sudoers file's syntax is checked for
     correctness before applying the changes.

*** Usage:
Save this playbook to a file named =configure_sudo_access.yml=, and run it using:

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook configure_sudo_access.yml
#+end_src

*** Important Notes:
- Ensure that the user running the playbook can execute commands with sudo
  privileges.
- As always, be cautious when modifying the =sudoers= file to avoid locking out
  sudo access due to syntax errors.

*** What whould be the ansible command to add sice user to sudo group?

To add the user =sice= to the =sudo= group using Ansible, you can use the =user=
module with the following command:

#+begin_src bash
ansible all -m user -a "name=sice group=sudo append=yes" --become --ask-become-pass
#+end_src

This command does the following:

- =-m user=: Uses the =user= module.
- =-a "name=sice group=sudo append=yes"=: Adds the user =sice= to the =sudo= group,
  with the =append=yes= option ensuring the user is added to the group without
  removing them from others.
- =--become --ask-become-pass=: Elevates privileges and prompts for the password
  if required.

*** is it posible to convert the previous command to a playbook that also asks for become pass?

Yes, you can create an Ansible playbook to add the user =sice= to the =sudo= group
and prompt for the become password. Here's an example of such a playbook:

#+begin_src yaml :tangle ansible/tasks/add_sice_to_sudo.yml
---
- name: Add user to sudo group
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  vars_prompt:
    - name: "ansible_become_pass"
      prompt: "Enter your sudo password"
      private: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure user sice is in the sudo group
      user:
        name: sice
        group: sudo
        append: yes
    - name: Allow members of the sudo group to run sudo without a password
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/sudoers
        regexp: '^%sudo'
        line: '%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
        validate: 'visudo -cf %s'

#+end_src

*** Explanation:
- *=hosts: all=*: Applies the playbook to all hosts in the inventory.
- *=become: yes=*: Enables privilege escalation.
- *=vars_prompt=*: Prompts the user for the sudo password.
- *=tasks=*: Contains the tasks to be performed.
- *=user= module*: Ensures the user =sice= is added to the =sudo= group.

To run the playbook, save it as =add_sice_to_sudo.yml= and execute:

#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook add_sice_to_sudo.yml
#+end_src
